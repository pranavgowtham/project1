		<h1>My Interests</h1>
		<p>My interests are highly varied and often not limited to a fixed list. I tend to try out new things all the time and 
		explore. However, there are a few that have stuck since quite a while. Here are a few of them.
		</p>
		<h2>Football</h2>

		<p>Like most people my age, I'm a football addict. I play football, follow football, talk football etc. My favourite club is an English team called Manchester City Football Club. My favourite players are Marco Reus and Marco Verratti. On 25 May 2009, I signed a four-year contract with Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach. On 28 August 2009, I scored my first Bundesliga goal in a game against Mainz 05 after a 50-metre solo run, and since then became a prolific goalscorer for my club under Lucien Favre. At the start of the 2011–12 season, I began the season in fine form, scoring seven goals in 12 matches.
		</p>
		<h2>Music</h2>

		<p>Just like football, music is one of my greatest passions. I taught myself to play the piano and I'm looking to learn drumming. At any random point in the day, odds are you'll catch me with my earphones on. My favourite genre is metal, mostly folk and prog. Folk metal is a relatively unknown genre which involves the fusion of traditional folk music with the metal. My favourite band is a folk metal band called 'Eluveitie'. Other bands I like include: Dream Theater, Poets of The Fall, Rammstein, Ensiferum and Arctic Monkeys.  
		</p>
		<h2>Travelling</h2>
		<img class="wrap" src="swiss.jpeg" alt="Switzerland" width="384" height="216">
		<p>Though I haven't travelled very extensively as of yet, it is one of my primary targets. Among my list of places to visit, the top few are Finaland, New Zealand and Switzerland. In December 2014, I was fined over £500,000 for driving without a licence, having been issued with speeding tickets on at least five occasions since 2011 without authorities knowing that I was not licensed. When convicted, I said, <q>The reasons I did it are something I cannot really understand.</q> Prior to my conviction, I had appeared in commercials for cars and petrol.</p>
