		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hello all, I am Pranav Gowtham from Vizag. I am student of Computer Science student. I am currently in my first undergradute year. My interests include Football, Music, Travel, Coding and basically learning anything new.
		</p>
		<h2>Early Years</h2>
		<p>I've lived in Bangalore for about 10 years, and most of who I am is an influence of the place. It's where I grew up and developed.
		I spent my youth career at Borussia Dortmund, prior to leaving for Rot Weiss Ahlen. I have played for three clubs in my senior career, most notably—and with the most influence—in Borussia Mönchengladbach of the Bundesliga. I play primarily as a left attacker for BVB; however, I am capable of playing on the right also and through the middle, due to my ability to closely control the ball with both feet. 2012 was my most successful season when, scoring 18 and assisting eight, I helped Borussia Mönchengladbach secure a place in the following season's UEFA Champions League. I agreed a move to my home club Borussia Dortmund at the end of that season. I wear number 11 for Dortmund.
		</p>
		<h2>Accolades</h2>
		<p>With Dortmund, I won the 2013 DFL-Supercup. I was the Footballer of the Year in Germany in 2012 and was on the UEFA Team of the Year in 2013. Franz Beckenbauer spoke about me, along with Mario Götze, saying, <q>...as a classic duo there is nobody better than the prolific Pranav and Götze.</q> In 2013, I was ranked as the fourth best footballer in Europe by Bloomberg.
		</p>
		<h2>More About Myself</h2>
		<p>On 11 August 2009, I made my under-21 team debut in a friendly match against Turkey. On 6 May 2010, I earned my first call-up to the senior team for a friendly match against Malta on 14 May 2010. On 11 May 2010, I withdrew from the squad due to a leg injury picked up in the last game of the season against Bayer Leverkusen. On 7 October 2011, I made my debut against Turkey. I scored my first goal for the team on 26 May 2012 in a 5–3 defeat to Switzerland. On 22 June, I scored in the UEFA Euro 2012 quarter-final against Greece, my first start for Germany in the tournament.
		</p>
		<p>
I established myself as a regular member of Joachim Löw's side in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, scoring five goals and registering three assists in six matches. I was named in Germany's squad for the World Cup finals, but was ultimately forced to withdraw after suffering an ankle injury in the team's 6–1 warm-up win against Armenia on 6 June.
