		<h2>Piano</h2>

		<p>I've been teaching myself the piano for the past 3 years. I just play a few basics pieces. Mozart and Haydn are undeniable influences. For example, My quintet for piano and winds is said to bear a strong resemblance to Mozart's work for the same configuration, albeit with my own distinctive touches. But my melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterization of emotion all set me apart from my influences, and heightened the impact some of my early works made when they were first published.

		<h2>Juggling and Speedcubing</h2>
		<p>Two of my occasional hobbies are Speedcubing and Juggling; sometimes even a mixture of both. Speedcubing involves solving the Rubik's cube as quickly as possible, using both hands, one hand or even blindfolded. The given video shows and example.
